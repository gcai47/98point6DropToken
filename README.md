# 98point6DropToken

This is my submission for the 98point6 coding challenge, 98point6 Drop Token.

To use the program, first download or clone the repo.

You can use `ant compile` to compile the program. 
Then use `ant run` to run the program.
Alternatively you can use change into the **build** directory and use `java CLMain` to run the program. 
Finally, to clean the workspace, use `ant clean`.
